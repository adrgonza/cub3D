## Introduction

Cub3D is a simple 3D game engine inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D. It uses raycasting to render a 3D environment from a 2D map, allowing the player to navigate through the game world and interact with objects. Cub3D provides a basic first-person perspective and supports features such as textured walls, sprite rendering, and simple collision detection.

## Usage

To use Cub3D, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adrgonza/cub3d.git
    ```

2. Build the program:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. Run Cub3D with a map file as an argument:

    ```bash
    ./cub3d maps/map.cub
    ```

4. Use the arrow keys to move forward, backward, and turn left or right. Press ESC to exit the game.

## Features

Cub3D supports the following features:

- Raycasting rendering engine
- Textured walls and floors
- Sprite rendering
- First-person perspective
- Basic collision detection
- Customizable maps using a simple configuration file

## Building

To build Cub3D, simply run:

```bash
make
```
